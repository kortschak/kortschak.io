abstract = "piRNAs are critical for transposable element (TE) repression and germ cell survival during the early phases of spermatogenesis, however, their role in adult germ cells and the relative importance of piRNA methylation is poorly defined in mammals. Using a mouse model of HEN methyltransferase 1 (HENMT1) loss-of-function, RNA-Seq and a range of RNA assays we show that HENMT1 is required for the 2â€™ O-methylation of mammalian piRNAs. HENMT1 loss leads to piRNA instability, reduced piRNA bulk and length, and ultimately male sterility characterized by a germ cell arrest at the elongating germ cell phase of spermatogenesis. HENMT1 loss-of-function, and the concomitant loss of piRNAs, resulted in TE de-repression in adult meiotic and haploid germ cells, and the precocious, and selective, expression of many haploid-transcripts in meiotic cells. Precocious expression was associated with a more active chromatin state in meiotic cells, elevated levels of DNA damage and a catastrophic deregulation of the haploid germ cell gene expression. Collectively these results define a critical role for HENMT1 and piRNAs in the maintenance of TE repression in adult germ cells and setting the spermatogenic program."
abstract_short = "Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs found in great abundance within both embryonic and adult male germ cells. Within embryonic germ cells, piRNAs have a well-recognized role in transposable element (TE) silencing, however, their role in adult cells remains poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that HENMT1 dysfunction and the resultant piRNA instability dramatically impacts multiple aspects of adult germ cell biology. Specifically, pachytene piRNAs are required to maintain TE silencing in adult germ cells and to set the spermatogenic gene expression program. piRNA loss leads to a more active chromatin state in the regulatory regions of numerous normally haploid germ cell genes and their precocious expression during meiosis, followed by a catastrophic deregulation of gene expression in haploid cells and male sterility."
